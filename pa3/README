FindComponents.c  handles I/O, uses helper function, includes main()
Graph.c     contains Graph ADT function implementations
	* front of list S is top of stack in DFS() and Visit()
	* DFS() pops from stack S and Visit() pushes to new temporary stack newS then in DFS() copy newS to S then freeList(&newS)
Graph.h     contains Graph ADT function declarations
	*addArcHelper exists for initial confusion regarding increasing size of G but issue was resolved by editing addEdge(). Kept the same because I did not want to rewrite.
GraphTest.c test harness for Graph ADT functions
List.c      contains List ADT function implementations
List.h      contains List ADT function declarations
